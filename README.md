ARFF Data Source in Apache Spark
============

A native data source to support the Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) on Apache Spark. 

The implementation extends seamlessly the Apache Spark source code, therefore the file is 
read using the same syntax as with the official supported formats. 

Examples
--------

See `src/org/apache/spark/examples` for examples.
