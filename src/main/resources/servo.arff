% 4. Relevant Information:
% 
%    Ross Quinlan:
% 
%    This data was given to me by Karl Ulrich at MIT in 1986.  I didn't 
%    record his description at the time, but here's his subsequent (1992) 
%    recollection:
%  
%      "I seem to remember that the data was from a simulation of a servo
%      system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a
%      sliding carriage of some sort.  It may have been on of the
%      translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab.  In any
%      case, the output value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time
%      required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set
%      point."
%  
%    (Quinlan, ML'93)
% 
%    "This is an interesting collection of data provided by Karl 
%     Ulrich.  It covers an extremely non-linear phenomenon - predicting the 
%     rise time of a servomechanism in terms of two (continuous) gain settings
%     and two (discrete) choices of mechanical linkages."
